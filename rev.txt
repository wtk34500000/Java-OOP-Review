Object: Object can be defined as an instance of the class.  It has state and behavior.

Class: A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

Advantages of OOPs over Procedure Oriented Programming:
OOPs makes development and maintenance easier wheres in a Procedure Oriented Programming language it not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.
OOPs provide data hiding whereas Procedure Oriented Programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.

Constructor: Constructor is called when an instance is created.
Types of constructors: 
Default constructor - no argument
Parameterized constructor - has argument

Rules to creating a constructor:
Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
A constructor must have no return type.
A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.

Constructor vs Method
Constructor:
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.
The constructor name must be the same as the class name.
The Java complier provides a default constructor if you don't have any in class.
Method:
A Method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A method must have a return type.
The method name may or may not be the same as class name.
The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.

OOP Pillars:
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which new objects that are built upon existing classes.  Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.  we use the key word EXTENDS.

Advantages of Inheritance:
For code reusability
For method overloading


Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.  the most common use of polymorphism in OOP is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

Method Overloading: if a class has multiple methods having the same name but different parameter, it is known as method overloading.

Different ways to overload a method:
By changing the number of arguments
by changing the data type

Method Overriding: if subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding.

Method Overloading vs Method Overriding:
Method Overloading:
Parameter must be different.
Return type can be same or different in method overloading.
Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.
method overloading is performed within class.
Method Overriding:
Parameter must be same.
Return type must be same.
Method overriding is the example of runtime polymorphism.
Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A relationship.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.  

Advantages of Encapsulation: 
It provides you the control over the data.
It is a way to achieve data hiding because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.

Access Modifier: There are 4 types
Private
protected
Public 
Default







Abstraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.

Two way to achieve abstraction
Abstract class
Interface 

Abstract class: a class is declared abstract is known as an abstract class.  it can have abstract and non-abstract methods.  it needs to be extended and its method implemented.  i cannot be instantiated.

Abstract class
Must be declared with a key word ABSTRACT
It cannot be instantiated.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods
It can have constructors and static methods

Interface: An interface is a reference type in Java.  It is similar to a class.  It is a collection of abstract methods.  It only contains behaviors that a class implements.

Interface 
It cannot be instantiated.
It does not contain any constructors
It can only have static and final field
It can extend multiple interface
All methods in an interface are abstract
An interface is not extended by a class, it is implemented by a class

========================================================================

While loop vs do while loop
while loop runs zero to more times, do while loop runs at least one to more times.

Static Keyword: 
Static keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management. we can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks, and nested class.  The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

Final KeyWord:
The final keyword can be applied with variables, methods and class.
final variables cannot change value.
final methods cannot override it
Final class cannot Inheritance  


Sting:
Strings is a sequence of characters.  in Java, strings are treated as object.
Packages:

Order: package -> import -> class 


Exceptions:
Exceptions are event that occur during the execution of the programs.  Like divide by zero, array out of boundâ€¦

Categories of the Exceptions:
Checked Exceptions
Unchecked Exceptions
Error

Checked Exceptions: are the exceptions that are checked at compile time.  E.g: when you try to read a file input and the path was incorrect, it will throws a filenotfound exception.

Unchecked Exceptions: are the exceptions that are checked at run times. under error and runtime exceptions are unchecked, every thing else is checked.  
e.g., let say u have an array of size 2 and u try to access the 3rd position. 

Throw vs Throws
Throws is used to postpone the handling of a checked exception and throw is used to invoke an exception explicitly.

Array:
Array is an object which contains element of the similar data type.  it is index base.  fixed size.

Advatage:
can access any of the data inside array by providing a index number

Disadvantage:
Size limited

Collection:
List -arrayist, linked list 
Set - hash set
Map - hash map

=======================================================================





DataBase:

Database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

Relational database is a type of database.  it is organized into tables.

RDMS is a program to allow you to create, update and manage a relational database.

SQL is a programing language to communicate with the database.

Primary key contains unique value and cannot be null. one per table.

Foreign key is a key to used to link table together. Also called referencing key.


SQL Statements:
DDL: data definition language - CREATE, ALTER, DROP
DML: data manipulation language - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DCL: data control language - GRANT, REVOKE
TCL: transaction control language -ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, COMMIT

========================================================================

WEB:

HTML: is a markup language for building website.

CSS: is used to add styling to your website. Inline style, internal style and external style.

Javascript: is the programming language for the Web.  it can update and change both html and css.  it can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
